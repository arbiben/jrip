p2 - Step 1

in order to run my jrip.py file you just need to type python jrip.py.
the addresses are hardcoded (as suggested by one of the TA's).
The propmt will ask you to insert a number between 0 and 100,
the nuber you input will determine the drop rate for the UDP packets.

the program will send 100 packets, and after running it will report how many
packets dropped out of 100 attempts.

after every packet that is sent, a message will appear indcating if the
packet was sent, or if it was dropped. If it was sent, th answer from 
your server will appear.



bradcast every 10 secs my jrip table
be able to receive packets 
listen on one port
update my table 
I receive the cost to the neigbort 
if there is no data - send to shortest path
