Ben Arbib - project 2 report (ba2490)

I've been using python 3.6 for this project

part 1
This part has been modified since the first submission
It receives - port num, loss rate, and hosts as arguments
sends 100 packets to each host and some will drop based on the loss rate

part 2
GBN - same inputs as part1
also sends 100 packets, but it makes sure that all 100 packets arrive at the destination
I used the sliding window that moved based on the last packet received.
In addition, I manage incomming packets and send ACK's only when all previous packets arrived
after all transactions, stdout will present the drop rate based on calculation

part 3,4
hold a table with all nodes and broadcast the table to neighbors every 10 seconds
if new info arrives, update table and broadcast again
